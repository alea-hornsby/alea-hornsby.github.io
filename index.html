	<h1> What is Dungeons and Dragons? </h1>
	<p> Dungeons and Dragons is a game where you work with your friends to create a story. One person plays the narrator, and all your other friends play the characters in the story.</p>
	<p> The narrator comes up with a story to tell, and the players create characters through which they can interact with this story however they choose. </p>

	<h1>How To Play</h1>
	<p>Whenever a character wants to do something, the DM can ask them to roll some dice. The actionâ€™s success depends on how high you roll. The higher you roll, the more likely you are to succeed in the action.</p>
	<p>Some characters may be better at certain kinds of actions. How skilled a character is is represented by numbers, commonly referred to as stats. The higher the stat, the better the character is at that kind of thing. If a character has a high enough stat in a category, they can get a bonus that they can add to their dice rolls when the action they want to perform falls in that category. For example, if my character has a 15 in the strength category, that means that I can add 2 to whatever I roll when I roll for strength related things.</p>
